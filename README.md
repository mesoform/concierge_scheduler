#### Verification

##### Automated tests

To run the tests included in this project, use following steps:
1. `$ cd ${PROJECT_DIR}/src`
2. `$ python -m unittest discover`

Optional step may be carried out to ensure code complies with Python 3:
3. `$ python3 -m unittest discover`

_Note that Python versions on commands `python` and `python3` may
vary depending on current machine set up._

Desired output on both step `2.` and `3.` is something like:
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.002s

OK
```
_Note that number of tests ran and time to run may vary as this
project develops._


__Warning:__ Please always make sure there are more than 0 tests ran
as that is an indication of a problem.
